Hi, I'm Achal! This is my extremley-negected personal website + blog.

I'm currently a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [Reddit](https://reddit.com/).


---

I spent 5 years as an Engineer at [Tecton](https://tecton.ai), a startup building a data platform for ML.

Before this, I was an Engineer at Uber - I was the tech lead for the Deep Learning Inferencing project within Michelangelo, the Machine Learning Platform team. I also helped build Hailstorm, a load generation platform.

At Amazon Fulfillment Technologies in Seattle, I wrote software for forecasting + planning for Fulfillment Centers.

I'm interested in Systems, ML, and Scalability professionally, and a variety of things in general.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achalnshah/), and [github](https://github.com/achals) but, I'm most reliably reachable via email.

I'm originally from Ahmedabad, India, where my parents, both of whom are doctors, currently reside.

My Resume can be found [here](/resume.pdf).

In 2025 I moved over my blog to ghost.io at https://blog.achals.com.
Some old stuff I wrote is still up at [/archive](/archive).
