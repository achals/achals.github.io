Hi, I'm Achal! This is my extremley-negected personal website + blog.

I'm currently a software engineer at a stealth Data/ML Startup. 

---

Before this, I was an Engineer at Uber - I was the tech lead for the Deep Learning Inferencing, a subteam within the Machine Learning Platform team. I also helped build Hailstorm, a load generation platform.

At Amazon Fulfillment Technologies in Seattle, I wrote software for forecasting + planning for Fulfillment Centers. 

I'm interested in ML Systems, Distributed Systems and Scalability professionally, and a variety of things in general.
