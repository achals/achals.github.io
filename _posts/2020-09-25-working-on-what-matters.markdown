I recently read a post by Will Larson that really spoke to me and I wanted to share: [Work On What Matters](https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters)

In Tech, I've found that there's a great deal of freedom in the day-to-day of what problems you can choose to solve. While this is one of the great parts of being in Tech, it's also a potential trap - the self-determination means that you can convince yourself that you're working on "important" things, when in fact you're just indulging yourself. 

Having the vocabulary of identifying these traps is powerful - it's helped me keep myself honest and focused on the things that actually the move the needle for the business, and my personal career. Check Will's post out!
