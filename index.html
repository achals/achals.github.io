Hi, I'm Achal Shah, a software engineer at Uber Technologies. I'm in the Application Platform team, building tools and infrastructure to ensure that internal services are healthy/well-scaled. I'm interested in Distribute Systems and Scalable systems professionally, and a variety of things in general.
<BR></BR>
I worked for over two years at Amazon Fulfillment Technologies in Seattle, where I worked on solving operational problems at scale. My first team owned software for the sortaion process inside the fulfillment centers. Next, I worked in the forecasting space, aimed specifically for the problem of fulfillment planning.

I previously interned at Raytheon BBN Technologies, working on the <a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/solicitations_fuse.html">FUSE</a> project.

As a grad student, I'm worked on an independent study on <a href = "https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~datamine/wiki/index.php?title=Eigenwords">Eigenwords</a> with

I joined Amazon.com in the fulfillment space in July, following my graduation. I initially worked on the Sortation team, but at the start of 2014 I moved to the team dealing with Charge Forecasting and Labor Rate Prediction. I've been having the time of my life in Seattle so far, learning loads and doing things that make an impact on customers everyday!
