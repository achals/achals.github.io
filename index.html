Hi, I'm Achal Shah, a software engineer at Amazon Fulfillment Technologies. I'm interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Pocessing, and Big Data. I previously interned at Raytheon BBN Technologies, working on the <a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/solicitations_fuse.html">FUSE</a> project.
<BR></BR>
As a grad student, I'm worked on an independent study on <a href = "https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~datamine/wiki/index.php?title=Eigenwords">Eigenwords</a> with
<a href = "http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/">Prof. Lyle Ungar</a>
<BR></BR>
You can find me on <a href= "http://www.linkedin.com/pub/achal-shah/5/79b/949">LinkedIn</a>, <a href = "https://twitter.com/achals">Twitter</a>, and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/achal.shah">Facebook</a>.
<BR></BR>
I'm originally from Ahmedabad, India, where my parents, both of whom are doctors, currently reside.
<a href = "http://www.linkedin.com/in/rushinnshah">My brother</a> currently works at Apple, and
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rishita-anubhai/14/474/685">my wife</a> is at Microsoft.
<BR></BR>
I joined Amazon.com in the fulfillment space in July, following my graduation. I initially worked on the Sortation team, but at the start of 2014 I moved to the team dealing with Charge Forecasting and Labor Rate Prediction. I've been having the time of my life in Seattle so far, learning loads and doing things that make an impact on customers everyday!
